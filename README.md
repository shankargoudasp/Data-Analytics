# Univariate-Time-Series-Analysis

 
## ABSTRACT 

This research explores the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), 
specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, to the univariate time 
series analysis of stock prices. This study aims to leverage the ability of LSTM 
networks to capture long-term dependencies and temporal patterns within stock 
price data, which traditional models might overlook. By analysing historical stock 
price data, the study seeks to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting 
future stock prices with greater accuracy. The outcomes of this research have the 
potential to enhance investment strategies and risk management practices by 
providing more reliable stock price predictions.
